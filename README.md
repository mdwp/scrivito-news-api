A React component/Scrivito widget which shows how to work with external REST-APIs.

**Note:** The free plan from newsapi.org only allows requests from **localhost**

## Installation

Open your terminal.

`$ cd` to your Scrivito project

```
$ npm install scrivito-news-api
```

Import the widget in your javascript (e.g. in `index.js` or `Widgets/index.js`).

Add this line to your index.js:

```
import "scrivito-news-api";
```

## Widget Configuratiom
First you need an API-Key from https://newsapi.org/register.
You can save the Key in the widget configuration form. Also choose a category for the news the widget should render.

## Development

With `npm run build` you can build the package into `build/`.

With `npm start` you'll start a continues process, that rebuilds `build/` automatically once the source code is changed.

To add this library locally do the following in your scrivito app:

```
npm install file:<path to build folder>
```

e.g.

```
npm install file:../scrivito-news-api/build/
```

To publish the package:

```
npm i && npm run build && cd build/ && npm publish
```

## Check code quality

With `npm run eslint` and `npm run es-check` you can check your coding quality.
